# @vcmap/multi-view

> Part of the [VC Map Project](https://github.com/virtualcitySYSTEMS/map-ui)

The multi-view plugin adds multiple views/maps to the main VcsMap. When navigating in the main map, all views are updated. It is also possible to move in one of the multi-views. Clicking on the view title will change the viewpoint in the main map.

- Version 1.x.x:

  - Plugin cannot be configured.
  - All views are oblique maps, 4 in total, with directions north, east, south, west.
  - There is only one layout, which is a panel on the right.
  - The multi-view panel can be resized.

- Future development ideas:
  - Plugin can be configured.
  - Views can be other maps like OpenlayersMap and CesiumMap.
  - More layouts could be added.
  - Configuration can be changed in the UI.
